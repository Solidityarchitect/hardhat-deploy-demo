# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Solidityarchitect/hardhat-deploy-demo.git
cd hardhat-deploy-demo
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deployV1.js --network sepolia
npx hardhat run scripts/deployV2.js --network sepolia
```
